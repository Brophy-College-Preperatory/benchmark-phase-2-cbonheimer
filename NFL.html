  <center><p> Damar Hamlin is the player making the tackle in this picture. After making the basic tackle he stood up but then collapsed onto husover. He suffered cardiac arrest on the field and had CPR done for 10 minutes. When he was tackling the player he had hard contact right when the heart was at rest. The heat is pumping but after each pump it rests. When he tackled him his heart hit Tee Higgins and was sent in to shock. Which made the heart stop. He was rushed to the hospital and stayed there for a couple weeks. It took him 14 months to get back onto the field. He has been a very good saftey in the NFL since then.  </p></center>

  <center><p> As you can see in the video, Damar's chest gets a hard blow while making the tackle. The chances for this to happen to his heart were very slim. Luckily the paramedics and athletic trainers for the Bills recovered his heart on the field.  </p></center>
