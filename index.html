    <center><p>I designed my website around injuries in sports beacuse I love learning about sports and talking about it. This website will bring awareness to the injuries of athletes and how they happened. Some sports injuries are often overlooked, you may have seen Damar hamlin when he fell on the field and basically looked dead. On this website I can tell you what happended in the situation and what his recovery process was like. So I wanted to create a page that offers valuable information on those kinds of incidents. 
        By providing images and videos of athletes I can analyze and share what I think about them. </p></center>
