    <center><p>This is Kevin Durant after tearing his achilles in the finals against the Toronto Raptors. He was sizing up the defender then pushed off his back foot. Which you could see his achilles rupture and recooil under the skin. His muscles atrophied and he said his right calf will never be as a strong as the left ever since the injury. He went to recovery 2 times a day for many hours. Sometimes he went 3 times. He tried his hardest to recover and get back on the court. It took him 552 days to get back onto the court.</p></center>
