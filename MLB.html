    <center><p>This is Shohei Ohtani from the Los Angeles Dodgers. He suffered a UCL(Ulnar Collateral Ligament) tear last season. Which occurs when pitchers wip their arms down when throwing. Which puts lots of strain on the elbow. Especially in MLB pitchers since they pitch so hard and put so much spin on the ball. He had to have a surgery known as Tommy John's to recontruct the UCL. It takes a graft from either the hamstring, big toe extenser, or the palmaris longus tendon from the forearm. The recovery usally takes 9 months and sometimes longer.  </p></center>

    <center><p>This is the elbow. You can see how the UCL is torn. It is a very important ligament that holds the elbow together.</p></center>
